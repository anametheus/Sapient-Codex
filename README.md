# What is the Sapient Codex?

## Introduction

The Sapient Codex is an evolving repository of attempts to understand reality. It inevitably grapples with fundamental philosophical questions, or, casually speaking, simply aims to understand what's going on, what we are, and what is worth doing and being, in the most succinct and elegant way possible, structured in a way that permits an endless complexity and diversity of perspectives to ceaselessly emerge. 

The aim of the Sapient Codex is to present what appear to be universal patterns, particular examples being used only for illustrative purposes or as a launch pad for reflection and revision. In short, it aims for a philosophical understanding of the world [_under the aspect of eternity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_specie_aeternitatis) rather than being a record of historical events.

## Infrastructure

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) are being used because they provide a free & robust system architecture that allows for an unlimited amount of branches \(or forks\) to develop, with some branches later being able to be re-integrated to the main trunk or in the case of a fork, the codex being cloned and independently developed. Moreover, revision history and attribution of contributions are automatically generated, while the interface is simple and intuitive without lacking the necessary features to create a rich multimedia experience. It's published under a [GPL-2.0 license](https://github.com/anametheus/Sapient-Codex/blob/master/LICENSE), which means anyone can download, “run”, modify, redistribute free copies and modified versions of it. It's like the WordPress Codex but for understanding reality and building lives rather than understanding blogging infrastructure and building websites.

Let's see how this works with edits from strangers.
